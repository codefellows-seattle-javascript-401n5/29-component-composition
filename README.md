### Description:

This is a front-end REACT application that allows the user to make a list.  The user fills in the input and note boxes, than clicks the submit button.  From there the new note is submitted as a list item to the unordered list.  I hope you find my application useful, enjoy.

### Instructions

* fork and clone the repository
* npm i
* npm run watch (this should display the application in your browser)
* type in your subject or title of the note you are creating
* type the note that you would like to add to the list
* click submit and watch it get added to your list
